It’s commonly used to support Grafana features like exporting dashboards, generating images for alert notifications, and creating PDF reports.

              - generic [ref=e230]: Modern AI agents are now highly advanced, frequently becoming essential components of engineering workflows and deployment pipelines. However, operating these systems often feels like trying to navigate a ship through a dense fog. When an agent errors, slows down, or consumes excessive resources, engineers find themselves adrift, lacking the navigational charts needed to diagnose the problem. The absence of deep insight makes debugging, performance tuning, and cost management unnecessarily difficult.
